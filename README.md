# GraphQuill's Mock GraphQL API
This GraphQL API was created and used for testing during the development of [GraphQuill](https://github.com/oslabs-beta/GraphQuill). GraphQuill is a real-time GraphQL API exploration extension for VSCode.

In an effort to allow other engineers to test out GraphQuill on a mock GraphQL API, we've open-sourced this repo. This project uses local installations of **PostgreSQL's Core Distribution** and **MongoDB Community Edition**. If you need to install them, refer to [How to Install PostgresQL and MongoDb](#to-install-postgresql-and-mongodb)

---

## Using this GraphQL API
Clone this repo: 

```javascript
git clone https://github.com/GraphQuill/Mock-GraphQL-API.git
```

Within the cloned folder, run the resetDbs script to seed the database (this script can also be used to reset the database to a "default"/predictable starting point, which is exactly what it was used for during GraphQuill's development):

```javascript
npm run resetDbs
```

Your GraphQL API has been setup now and seeded with data from [faker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/faker). Now you can use the [GraphQuill](https://github.com/oslabs-beta/GraphQuill) extension to view the API's schema, send queries or mutations and receive responses, all within VS Code ðŸ˜€

## To Install And Setup PostgreSQL and MongoDB: 
We recommend using homebrew for both installs if you are on macOs. Follows the links below to installation instructions. 
Install Postgres (we used v11.4 on macOs): https://www.postgresql.org/download/
Install MongoDB (we used v4.2.1 on macOs): https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/

**1. After installing Postgres**, you'll need to create a user 'graphquill' with the password 'graphquill' which has access to the graphquillpsql database. 
You may need to start the Postgres database on your computer. For macOS:
  * first check if homebrew has it running with:
    
    ```javascript
    brew services list
    ```

  * if it is not running, start it using:
    
    ```javascript
    brew services start postgresql
    ```

  * Open the postgres terminal: 
    
    ```javascript
    psql postgres
    ```

  * Then create a user:
    
    ```javascript
    CREATE USER graphquill WITH PASSWORD 'graphquill';
    ```

  * Create the database:
    
    ```javascript
    CREATE DATABASE graphquillpsql;
    ```

  * Give the graphquill user access to modify the database:
    
    ```javascript
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE graphquillpsql TO graphquill;
    ```
**2. After installing MongoDB** you will need to start the server. 

  * Again if you used homebrew you can check that using: 

    ```javascript
    brew services list
    ```

  * and start MongoDB using:
 
    ```javascript
    brew services start mongodb-community
    ```

After completing these database setups, you can continue along with using this repo. ([Instructions](#using-this-graphql-api))
